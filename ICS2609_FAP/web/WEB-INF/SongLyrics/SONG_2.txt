So crazy
Something crazy just happened
I don't know what's happening to me
Listen to my story

There was a lonely star, very small
But used its strength to shine
One day, the night sky flashed
And the star fell

It's so funny, who knew?
That this fate-like love has started then
I'm floating
I've never felt like this before
It's sweeter than honey

Somethin kinda crazy happens to me
It's like a lie, what happened?
You were a shining star
And now you're in my arms, crush
What is going on?

I can't believe it, I can't believe it, it's love

It became reality when it was just something
That happened in the movies before
It's like overcoming the distance between us
And the countless strangers of the universe
The fact that we met

It's so funny, we could've been so far apart
But we're the closest in today's world
I can't believe it
I'm so happy, I start to laugh
I think I've gotten a little strange

Somethin kinda crazy happens to me
It's like a lie, what happened?
You were a shining star
And now you're in my arms, crush
What is going on?

Your thoughts fill my head
I can't do anything without you
I think I became a fool
What is happening to me?

Somethin kinda crazy happens to me
It's like a lie, what happened?
You're my crush
Shining so I can spot you from far away
It's you, right?

Somethin kinda crazy happens to me
It's like a lie, what happened?
You were a shining star
And now you're in my arms, crush
What is going on?
