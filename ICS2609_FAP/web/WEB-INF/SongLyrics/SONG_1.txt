THE UST HYMN
God of all Nations 
Merciful Lord of our Restless Being 
Sweep with your Golden Lilies 
This Fountain of Purest Light
Trace with the Sails of the Galleons 
The Dream Beyond our Seeing 
Touch with the Flames of your Kindness 
The Gloom of our Darkest Night
Keep us in Beauty 
And Truth and Virtues Impassioned Embrace 
Ever your Valiant Legions 
Imbued with Unending Grace
